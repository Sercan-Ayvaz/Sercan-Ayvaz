  Hello! I am Sercan Ayvaz, a software developer with a degree 
in computer programming.

  I have experience in languages â€‹â€‹such as C#, Python and MySQL, 
and my passion for software development processes constantly 
drives me to learn new technologies.

  I aim to produce effective and efficient solutions by prioritizing 
user experience in the projects I develop. I also have 
in-depth knowledge of database management and application 
development. I also work with graphic design tools such as GIMP, 
taking visual elements into account in my projects.

  I love to interact with the community and gain new skills by 
contributing to open source projects. My goal is to constantly 
improve myself in the software world and contribute with innovative 
projects.

Follow me and share your feedback on my projects!
